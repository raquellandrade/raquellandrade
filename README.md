## Hi there ðŸ˜Š, I'm Raquel, frontend developer

Graduated in Internet Systems in 2012, I have worked with front end development since 2011. 
Among my specialties are: Information Architecture, development with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Vuejs, React and a focus on good usability practices on the web, in addition to working with agile methodologies to lead and develop teams.
<br>
The use of Gitflow, DevOps and Scrum are part of my work.
I am constantly studying, looking for new learning, especially in the areas of soft skills such as Emotional Intelligence, seeking to apply what I learn in my daily life. 
<br>
I like innovation and creativity, I know that challenges are what make us grow and learn.
